# beam-net
Matchmaking service for Splatoon 2 using Discord.

## Setting Up:

Install a custom fork of discord-py-slash-commands.
This is required because currently, discord-py-slash-commands doesn't support buttons.
Will switch back once discord-py-slash-commands v2.0 is released.

`pip install git+git://github.com/artem30801/discord-py-interactions.git@master`

[Documentation](https://discord-py-interactions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Also add a bot.json file to your project.
